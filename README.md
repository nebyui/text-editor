# Overview

This purpose of this project was to become familiar with C++ and see how it could apply to my seperate video game project. 

I chose to learn C++ because Godot game engine supports C++ scripts, so learning this programmin language will be helpful with seperate game projects. Additionally, C++ is a very commonly used and versetile language. 

This program is a simple text editor that is designed to save and load a player's theoretical progress and statistics from a theoretical game. Of course, actual game saving systems are significantly more complex, but it was a good learning experience to see how C++ can modify files and what contexts it could be used for.

# Future Work



- Implementing a way to save / load a theoretically inventory. 
- A simple text based console game could be made to encapsulate this program. Currently the user just inputs the given game triggers to change the values to be stored into the save file. 
- Variable names could be changed to be more clear of what their purpose is.
